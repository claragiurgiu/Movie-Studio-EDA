We need to consider factors such as the current trends in the film industry, the target audience, and the budget.\n",
    "In this project I will conduct market research to identify the types of films that are currently popular and that are likely to be successful in the future. By making films that are popular and that appeal to a wide audience, we can increase our chances of success. We can also build a reputation for making quality films, which will help us to attract top talent and secure funding for future projects."
